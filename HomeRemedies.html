                        My forays into the wonders of everyday kitchen ingredients
                        The importance of taking precautions against cold or chest congestion was the initial take away for me as I read about muscular dystrophy, a thought that remained etched in my mind, as I struggled to grapple with what the condition entailed.

As winter would approach or seasonal changes happened I began to explore the traditionally tried and tested gems of wisdom of grandma’s about one’s well being and health As access to internet was limited then, I would read and also try to find out from elders or friends the different types of remedies for simple basic things such as common cold, cough,indigestion etc. Thus began my journey of experimenting with different ingredients found commonly in one’s own kitchen and seeing what works best for my child’s needs. These were more as a precaution or at times to relieve the symptoms in addition to doctor’s advice and medication prescribed as required..

                    As winter would approach or seasonal changes happened I began to explore the traditionally tried and tested gems of wisdom of grandma’s about one’s well being and health As access to internet was limited then, I would read and also try to find out from elders or friends the different types of remedies for simple basic things such as common cold, cough,indigestion etc. Thus began my journey of experimenting with different ingredients found commonly in one’s own kitchen and seeing what works best for my child’s needs.

                    I also used betel leaves for relief from cold in the infancy stage. I would take one leaf and apply oil on both sides. Heat it slowly on the gas stove on both sides for a couple of seconds then when it is a little warm (please check the temperature ) I put it over the crown chakra and as soon as it is dry remove the leaf. c) When he was a toddler, I would steam the room using a humidifier which I would place near my son’s bed . Please ensure to keep the humidifier at a safe distance from the child's bed. I would add a couple of drops of eucalyptus oil in the humidifier. (However, one fallout is that the bedsheets would get stained due to the oily steam and it would leave a strong smell on the bed sheets!).</p>

                    <li>I give soups, rasam , kadi , curry leaves powder ( a popular dish in Andhra Pradesh made with coriander, pepper etc) mixed with hot rice and ghee, especially in winters.</li>

                <p>In the present times with widespread access to the internet and help of google one can find numerous home remedies for each and every condition. The benefits of the various common ingredients found in our kitchen are indeed amazing! But one has to exercise caution and try based on the climate of the place, a child’s requirement, age, medications and what is best suited for each individual. It is also advisable to consult and seek advice before just following them blindly.
